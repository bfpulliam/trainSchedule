# Train Schedule

In this bootcamp assignment, I created a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app also uses Bootstrap. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js to make it a time that is easier to read.

The schedule displays the train's name and time until next one arrives.
Users from many different machines are able to view same train times due to the information being stored in Firebase.
This app calculates's when the next train will arrive relative to the user's current time.

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
